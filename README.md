# Cornell Spectrum Imager

This repository contains a fork of the [original Cornell Spectrum Imager][CSI] (CSI). CSI is hosted on Goggle Code but the service is discontinued.

Another reason for forking CSI is to adapt it for running with [Fiji].

The following text has been taken from the [CSI wiki] at Google Code:

### More Details

An overview of the tool can be found in the article "The Open-Source Cornell Spectrum Imager", Paul Cueva, Robert Hovden, Julia A. Mundy, David A. Muller, **Microscopy Today 21**, 40-45 (2013). [DOI: 10.1017/S1551929512000995][DOI2]

Detailed discussion of the software with particular application to EELS analysis is discussed in our manuscript:"Data Processing For Atomic Resolution EELS", Paul Cueva, Robert Hovden, Julia A. Mundy, Huolin L. Xin, David A. Muller, **Microscopy and Microanalysis 18**, 667-675 (2012). [DOI: 10.1017/S1431927612000244][DOI]
